    "description": "I chose to write my website in Angular 2. Originally I wanted to write in ReactJS so I could learn it, but I ultimately decided against it because my current job develops in Angular 2. I tried keeping to our coding standards of having a data api and service for each page, with routers for each tab. I also stuck to object-oriented Typescript with models for each object retrieved. I plan on having a NodeJS server with a MongoDB to give all the data to the page as soon as I can find a stable server (currently running on a Beaglebone). I hope you enjoy!"

    "description": "This project actually has 2 different versions, one in Angular 2 and one in ReactJS. I originally wrote it in Angular 2, but I wanted to learn ReactJS and Webpack. The Angular 2 side is built using Angular CLI with Typescript, and employs the coding standards of a data api and service for each page as well as routing. The ReactJS version has a homemade Webpack & Babel configuration, and uses React Router. As of now, this website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi, but I have future plans to deploy it to a Google AppEngine.",
